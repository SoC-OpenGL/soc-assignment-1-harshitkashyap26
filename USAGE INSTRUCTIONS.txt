(1) Download The Visual Studio Project Folder and open it via Visual Studio. C++ Workspace 
should be installed on your Visual Studio to compile, build and run the codes. GLFW and GLEW
files are already included in the project and linked properly.

OR

(2) Download the 'OpenGL-code' folder. It contains only the cpp files (shaders loaded
internally). Check the directory and routes of required GLFW and GLEW files from the Visual
studio project folder and prepare makefiles accordingly.

NOTE: Since the size of Project Folder is too large, some unrequired files like the cache
files could be avoided from downloading as per the user's judgement
